	<description>Revisit to xrushna great mod "Elders Faction" https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215217049 
	\n Original description : 
	\n"Elders" is an ancient psycaster faction that awakened on multiple worlds not too long ago. They hate outsiders, but you can befriend them.
	This mod adds:
	New faction;
	New way to gain psylink: sac of knowledge, the legacy of the ancient chemists from Elders faction. You can buy it from their bases and shaman traders;
	New drugs: anima joint that increases psychic sensivity and anima tea that increases psychic dissipation rate. You can buy them from Elders bases and shaman traders or craft it by yourself from anima fibers;
	New trait: "In harmony with nature". Disables a lot of mood penalties like ate without table, ate raw food, slept outside, slept on the ground, ate insect meat directly and ate insect meat as ingredient.</description>
